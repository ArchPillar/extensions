# ArchPillar Extensions

A collection of standalone .NET libraries that grew out of personal needs during real-world projects. Published in case they help anyone else. :)

## Libraries

### [ArchPillar.Extensions.Mapper](docs/mapper/)

Explicit object-to-object DTO mapping and LINQ/EF Core expression projection. One definition drives both in-memory mapping and IQueryable projection — with full IDE traceability.

### [ArchPillar.Extensions.Pipelines](docs/pipelines/)

A lightweight, allocation-free async middleware pipeline. `Pipeline<T>` composes `IPipelineMiddleware<T>` steps around an `IPipelineHandler<T>` terminal step as pre-built nested lambdas — reusable across invocations with zero per-call allocations on the synchronous hot path. Ships with built-in `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` integration and a drop-in `System.Diagnostics.Activity` middleware for distributed tracing.

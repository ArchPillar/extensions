# ArchPillar Extensions

A collection of standalone .NET libraries that grew out of personal needs during real-world projects. Published in case they help anyone else. :)

## Libraries

### [ArchPillar.Extensions.Mapper](docs/mapper/)

Explicit object-to-object DTO mapping and LINQ/EF Core expression projection. One definition drives both in-memory mapping and IQueryable projection — with full IDE traceability.

### [ArchPillar.Extensions.Pipelines](docs/pipelines/)

A lightweight, allocation-free async middleware pipeline. `Pipeline<T>` composes `IPipelineMiddleware<T>` steps around an `IPipelineHandler<T>` terminal step as pre-built nested lambdas — reusable across invocations with zero per-call allocations on the synchronous hot path. Ships with built-in `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` integration and a drop-in `System.Diagnostics.Activity` middleware for distributed tracing.

### [ArchPillar.Extensions.Primitives](docs/primitives/)

Foundational types for the rest of the family. Ships `OperationResult` / `OperationResult<TValue>`, `OperationProblem` (RFC 7807 `application/problem+json`-shaped), `OperationError`, `OperationStatus` (HTTP-aligned enum), `OperationFailure` and `OperationException`. AOT/trim-safe, zero dependencies beyond the BCL. Types live under the `ArchPillar.Extensions.Operations` namespace.

### [ArchPillar.Extensions.Commands](docs/commands/)

A small, in-process command dispatcher built on Pipelines and Primitives. `ICommand` and `ICommand<TResult>` flow through a single shared `Pipeline<CommandContext>`; cross-cutting concerns (transactions, logging, authorization) plug in as middlewares. Validation lives on the handler (`[CallerArgumentExpression]` auto-captures field names) and runs inside the pipeline so any user-supplied transactional middleware wraps both validation and execution. AOT/trim-safe, no runtime reflection at dispatch.
